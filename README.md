# moped
Moped (Mapped Object parser emitter Dispatcher) is a framework that uses a combination meta programming, policy, and traits base strategies to provide custom mappings to complex C++ class definitions. These mappings subsequently allow these classes to be populated by a variety of encoding formats. This project is currently in the pre release state and at this time is only supporting JSON and YAML with fix and SBE on the horizon. The encoding implementations use event based strategies that can driven by c++ input streams coupled with co routine support reducing the need for large heap allocations to accumulate buffers for large encodings. Additionally, target objects that would otherwise have large collections can instead opt to have dispatch handler functions for each collection entry when it's parsing is complete allowing the application to maintain a sensible memory footprint.
